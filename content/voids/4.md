### Process

Started this as a wall hanging. Tufted the top left black square first, then added the center squares. Halfway through I got a new long pile tufting machine and decided to pivot it into a rug instead. You can see the longer pile in the beige corners - that's where I started using the new machine. The rest is shorter pile from the original wall hanging plan.

### Materials

Yarn:
- Acrylic
- Wool
