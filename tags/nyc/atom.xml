        <content type="html" xml:base="https://gnarlyvoid.com/voids/9/">&lt;p&gt;This piece is dedicated to the G train in New York City.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G is an odd line. It does not touch Manhattan. It runs quietly through
Brooklyn and Queens, connecting places that feel adjacent but rarely centered.
It is often overlooked, often delayed, and deeply relied on by the people who
use it every day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rendered in soft fiber, the familiar green circle becomes tactile and slow.
What is usually signage and schedule turns into something physical - dense,
imperfect, and worn at the edges. The letterform holds its shape, but only just.
The pile absorbs sharpness. The symbol becomes an object.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the train itself, this piece is about persistence rather than spectacle.
About movement that happens off to the side. About systems that are lived in
more than they are noticed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transit mark translated into texture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
