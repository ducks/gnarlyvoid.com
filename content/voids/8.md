This is now my second batch of glazed pottery. I'm definitely seeing improvements
with my shaping and consistency. I was disappointed in a few of the overlapping
glaze experiments I tried but that's how you learn. At this point, I think I
have enough pots and experience that I can start to get a little pickier with
what I send to fire. I have a bunch of pinch pots that got bisque fired that I
hope to glaze fire and show soon.
