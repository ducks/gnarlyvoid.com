### Process

I'm a big fan of King Gizz and wanted to create a piece inspired by them. The alligator
is available in a simple 2d outline that was perfect for tufting. I decided to
mount it on a thin piece of birch that I painted bright purple. I got the paint
in the samples section for $2 and I think it provides a perfect backdrop.

This is an early piece so there are still some rough edges. The top of the back
could have been a thicker outline. I also chose not to give it pupils as I didn't
think it would look very good as a small dot of yarn.
