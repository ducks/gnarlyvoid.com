Between weaving, crocheting, and now tufting, we have a decent collection of yarn
going. We had been storing it stacked up in a tight little Ikea shelf but that made
it hard to sort and see what we had. I saw this idea online and thought it was
great because it both functions and looks good. This doesn't quite cover quite all
the fiber supply but it handles a lot of it. We are considering one more board
on the wall adjacent the right board.

### Process

First, I built some simple frames out of 1x2s. I did this to give the pegboard some
"depth" to allow for the pegs to stay in place. I could have used nylon spacers
but went this route instead. After that, I screwed the pegboards on top of this
frame. Then I flipped it over and attached 3 tooth hangers on each. I hung
these using drywall anchors because there was no stud perfectly where we wanted
it. With 3 hangers spreading out the load, I'm confident it should stay put.

### Materials

- 1x2s
- pegboards - (2) 2' x 4'
- screws
  - #8 - 1 1/2" (for the frame)
  - #6 - 1" (attaching pegboard to frame)
