description = "Abstract Dreamsicle balances warm density with cool pastel drift, using texture and pile height to create depth without hard edges. It's less about symmetry and more about how shapes settle when they're allowed to stay loose."

Exploring softness as structure.

Layered pastel forms drift and overlap, anchored by a dense, warm base that
grounds the composition. Rounded protrusions interrupt the surface like
half-remembered details, inviting touch as much as inspection.

I spent extra time trimming and shearing this one. I wanted the layers to look
like they were on top of each other and had "depth".
