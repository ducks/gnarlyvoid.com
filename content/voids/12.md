A hand-tufted rug inspired by traditional tattoo flash.

This piece features a bold five-petal flower with a bright yellow center,
saturated red petals, and heavy black outlines. The white halo gives the
design breathing room, while the deep green leaves ground it with contrast
and balance.

Built with thick pile and sharp color blocking, it's designed to read
clearly from a distance and feel plush up close. The sculpted silhouette
follows the leaves and petals, turning the graphic into a functional
object.

Classic flash energy, translated into fiber.
